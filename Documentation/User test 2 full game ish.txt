1. What's the mood, lighting, and scale of each scene? Mood of the indoor room is very much "start of game" like. I liked having some reading/instructions in a scroll form.  Outside is garden like. No issues with scale and lighting.
2. What are the controls of the game? Same as before. I couldn't figure out what the purple ball did near the house..and sometimes clicking a tile would turn it but other times it would turn the tile next to it.
3. If you get stuck, can you find the restart button? Yes.
4. What things are affected by physics/animation? Mm like the encouragement scrolls would fall to the ground. The sign by the door would flap when tapped.
5. What emotions is the game trying to evoke? I felt frustrated trying to figure out how it worked. But overall the theme was positive and hopeful through all the scrolls.
6. There are two different endings. How do you get those endings? Can't comment..couldn't figure it out.  I did figure out this time that energy limits your expansion and time refills energy (I think?) Which I didn't know last time what the spoons meant.  But still couldn't figure out the goal..like I thought maybe I'm supposed to build a path towards the door (but I also thought I must've just left from that house since I exited a door..but I come out of the house a few blocks away so maybe I'm supposed to go to the house) ..there were no other objects in sight to clarify the goal. But maybe that's part of the game. I dunno..
7. Any other comments? The word on the mat starts off as spoon and changes to energy after the first click. Glitch?

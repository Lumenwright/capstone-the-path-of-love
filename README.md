# The Path of Love
# Capstone project by Rose Chung

A tile maze game for Google Cardboard motivated by a story about love, patience, and persevering with depression. The game is designed to evoke emotions of frustration at not being able to do simple tasks despite sunny positivity and support, like life with a mental illness like depression. The game is also designed to evoke emotions of being uplifting and understanding of yourself and being compassionate about your own limits.
